1. in useEffect(), console.err is used instead of console.error.
--> use console.error.

2. in sortedBalances, lhsPriority is used, but it is not defined in scope.
--> replace lhsPriority with balancePriority.

3. the filter condition in sortedBalances returns true for balance amounts less than 0, and false for other amounts.
--> should return false for balance amounts less than 0 and true for others.

4. in formattedBalances, the formatted amount just uses toFixed() without actually specifying the decimal places.
--> specify the decimal places.

5. formattedBalances is created but not used.
--> use formattedBalances instead of sortedBalances in rows.

6. balance.blockchain is used in sortedBalances (to get balancePriority) but blockchain is not defined in the
   WalletBalance interface.
--> define blockchain in the WalletBalance interface.

7. Props extends BoxProps, but BoxProps is not defined.
--> remove BoxProps and define a Props interface.
